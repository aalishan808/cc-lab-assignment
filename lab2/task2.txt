Lab Task 2: Regular Expression for Relational Operators

Relational operators include:
  ==  (equal to)
  !=  (not equal to)
  >  (greater than)
  <  (less than)
  >=  (greater than or equal to)
  <=  (less than or equal to)

Here is a regex pattern to match these relational operators:

   regex
\b(?:==|!=|>=|<=|>|<)\b
   

Explanation:
-  \b  asserts a word boundary, ensuring that the operators are matched as whole entities.
-  (?:...)  is a non-capturing group for the alternatives.
-  ==|!=|>=|<=|>|<  specifies the relational operators you want to match.

 Examples of Usage

1.   Logical Operators:  
   - Text:  The condition A AND B is true. 
   - Regex match:  AND 

2.   Relational Operators:  
   - Text:  x >= 10 and y < 5 
   - Regex matches:  >= ,  <
