Lab Task 1: Regular Expression for Logical Operators

Logical operators generally include:
-  AND 
-  OR 
-  NOT 

Here is a regex pattern to match these logical operators:

   regex
\b(?:AND|OR|NOT)\b
   

Explanation:
-  \b  asserts a word boundary, ensuring that the operators are matched as whole words.
-  (?:...)  is a non-capturing group that groups the alternatives together.
-  AND|OR|NOT  specifies the logical operators you want to match.
